---
### [1.1.1] (2024-04-10)


### Bug Fixes

* Potential hotfix for rate limiting not working as expected


---
### [1.1.0] (2024-04-10)


### Features

* Implemented rate-limiting throughout the app to prevent abuse
* Reduced the amount of HTTP requests made when reloading or browsing `history.html`
* Improved how verification and recovery emails look
* Increased the failed sign in attempts limit from 3 to 5
* Added a section in the sign up and verification forms to indicate where the user are in their sign up process
* Verification emails now also state that the verification code is only valid for 15 minutes


### Bug Fixes

  * These requests shouldn't be possible, but this is just an extra precaution
<br>
* Fixed the height of the terms popup not adjusting to smaller screens


---
### [1.0.0] (2024-04-05)


### Features

* Users now have to sign up with an email address
  * A verification code will be emailed to the user, alongside a one-click link to verify their account
  * Since there are no active users, there's no need to implement functionality to request an email from existing users
<br>
* The sign up form now contains a "confirm password" input for users to type in their password again
  * This should help reduce the chances of users mistyping their passwords
<br>
* Implemented a sign in attempts counter to prevent brute-force attacks
  * The user's account is locked after 3 failed sign in attempts, and it requires them to recover it through their registered email
    * If a user signs in successfully before the sign in limit reaches 3, the limit is reset back to 0
    * If a user's account is locked, signing in is no longer possible
<br>
* Implemented an account recovery process
* Aligned the text in alert messages generated by `messagePopup.js`
* Added Terms of Service to the app under `termsOfService.html`
* Added a footer containing a link to the Terms of Service in the homepage
* First-time visiters will now see a non-intrusive popup message at the bottom informing them of our Terms of Service
  * This popup will appear on any page
  * Users can click the confirm button to quickly remove the popup
<br>
* Added a message in the sign up form stating that signing up means the user has accepted our Terms of Service
  * This is not really needed, as users are prompted with our Terms of Service when they first visit the app, but it's there as an extra precaution
<br>
* Changed the right button in the navbar to be light instead of purple


### Bug Fixes

* Fixed `redirectAfterDelayMilliseconds.js` displaying an error if the target doesn't end with .html, which caused issues if the target contained a query string
  * The function will now check if .html is included in the string, without checking the order. This is not an ideal solution, but bugs caused by this at least can't be produced by a user
<br>
* Fixed the duration of 'messagePopup.js` not being implemented properly 
* Fixed the SVG on the homepage not scaling down as the width got lower before it's completely removed


---
### [0.41.1] (2024-03-21)


### Features

* Added slightly more validation to the sign in form, to prevent sending an HTTP request for clearly incorrect credentials, effectively reducing unnecessary load on the backend


### Bug Fixes

* Disabled autocomplete in the session bill search bars
* Disabled auto-capitalization for the username inputs in both `signUp.html` and `signIn.html`
* Fixed longer error messages under password inputs breaking the position of the password-reveal icon
* Improved how descriptive form-validation error messages are in `signUp.html`
* Fixed failed API requests showing too much data, including failed password strings, which was a security concern


### Code Refactoring

* Slightly refactored the API logic and responses surrounding loginTokens


### Chore Changes

* Removed the leftover `patch-notes.txt` file


---
### [0.41.0] (2024-03-19)


### Features

* Added search bars to filter through bills by name in any given session


### Bug Fixes

* Fixed the bill modal overlay not fully covering the body in phone browsers
* Fixed a bug where editing bills created after v0.40.2 would always behave as if there are unsaved changes
  * Better object comparison coming in future patches


---
### [0.40.4] (2024-03-17)


### Features

* Added a cancel button to the session's start modal to make it more intuitive
* Removed the "Sign up" button from the hero section in `index.html`, as there's no need for it considering one is available in the navbar and is now always visible if the user is logged in
  * Removed the `Index` from `index.js` as it no longer serves a purpose


---
### [0.40.3] (2024-03-17)


### Features

* Reworked the navigation bar and ditched the drop-down menu
  * Drop-down menu didn't make a lot of sense when it only displayed two options, and finding it wasn't very intuitive to the user
<br>
* A "History" button will no longer be shown in the hero section of `index.html`, since the same button will now permanently be visible in the navbar


### Test Changes

* Removed `index.test.js` as it currently only contains one function that hides the "Sign up" button, which is not worth unit testing


---
### [0.40.2] (2024-03-15)


### Features

* Reworked the reset button in the session header
  * If a user is editing a session, the button will be renamed to "Revert", and will only function as a way of reverting any changes made in relation to the original session that is being edited
    * Reverting a session will affect the sharedWith value as well
<br>
  * If a user is not editing a session, regardless of whether or not they're logged in, the button will be named "Reset", and will function as a way of clearing all the bills in the session
    * Resetting a session has no affect on the sharedWith value, as there's no stored value to reset to
<br>
<bv>
* `messagePopup()` now accepts a third parameter called `durationMilliseconds`, which is set to 200 by default
  * This will help give the function more utility
<br>
* Added a total bill limit of 100 bills per session
  * The user will be notified when the limit is reached through a message in the header, and the add-bill buttons will be disabled


### Bug Fixes

* Fixed reverting a session not revering the sharedWith value


---
### [0.40.1] (2024-03-13)


### Features

* If a user is editing a session, the session's reset button will now also give the user an option to revert all the changes made in relation to the original session, in addition to the two existing options of canceling the action or proceeding with clearing all the bills
  * This feature doesn't make a lot of sense when a session that has been cleared is fully emptied. Further improvements coming in the next patch


### Bug Fixes

* Removed a leftover console log in `BillModal.js`
* Fixed the session's two clear buttons relying on DOM elements, instead of the sessionInfo object 
* Fixed input validation for a bill's unshared value displaying an error message despite the directly owed checkbox being checked
  * The unshared input value, if the directly owed checkbox is checked, is omitted and replaced with 0, so validating it is unnecessary


---
### [0.40.0] (2024-03-13)

### Features

* Reworked how the save button in `session.html` works
  * If the user is logged in and is not editing a session, it will simply save the session
  * If the user is editing a session and attempts to save it with no bills, they are advised that saving the session with no bills will result in it being deleted, and are asked to confirm or cancel the action
  * If the user is editing a bill and has made changes before clicking the save button (assuming there are still bills in the session), they will be prompted to confirm if they want to override the existing bill, opt to save the current session as a new session, or cancel the action
<br>

* Renamed `_saveSession()` to `_handleSaveSession()`. It will now handle the save logic instead, and call other functions accordingly
* Added `_deleteSession()`, `_updateSession()`, and `_addSession()` to `SessionHeader.js` to handle deleting, updating, and adding sessions respectively
  * These functions will be primarily called through `_handleSaveSession()`


### Code Refactoring

* Ensured that event listeners are removed before the confirm modal element is removed from the DOM, to prevent any potential circular reference issues


---
### [0.39.0] (2024-03-11)


### Features

* Checking the "directly owed by" checkbox now doesn't reset the unshared value to 0
  * This will help avoid negative user experience if the user accidentally checks the box
  * `BillModal.js` has been updated to set the unshared value to 0 if the bill if the form is submitted while the checkbox is checked
<br>
* Full keyboard navigation support implemented to `session.html`
* App should now have full keyboard navigation support
* Added a little animation to the bill modal form when it's shown

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed the ability to set a bill's unshared value to be equal to the bill's value itself
* Fixed a minor bug in the addition of "selected" class to the currency options in the start modal


### Code Refactoring

* Improved the look and styling for the "update shared with" button in the session header
* Updated the media queries for `session.html` to improve responsiveness


---

* Fixed very long sharedWith names breaking the structure of `session.html`
* Fixed very long bill total/split values causing line wraps in `session.html` 
* Fixed very long sharedWith names breaking the structure of `history.html`
* Fixed a leftover console log in `SessionContent.js`
* Fixed the bill's value and unshared value being evaluated against each other, before all inputs are evaluated separately first
* Fixed the "No previous sessions" text having a full height on browsers other than Chrome
* Potential fix to browsers suggesting credit card autocomplete for the log in and sign in forms


### Features

* Increased the character limit for bill names from 24 to 50
* Increased the character limit for sharedWith names from 20 to 50
* All dynamically input names and values can now be hovered and have their content fully displayed
  * This will help with any long values that are overflowing and not fully visible to the user


### Test Changes

* Updated the unit tests in `SessionElement.test.js`, `BillElement.test.js`, and `BillModal.test.js` to accommodate the changes in this patch


---
