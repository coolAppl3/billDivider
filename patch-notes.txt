ValidateUser.js:

  - Simplified the validation functions, making them only use a regular expression test, as this is mainly a second layer of safety and will most likely never encounter an invalid username or password. The frontend functions will take care of user feedback.

signUp.html:

  - Set the autocomplete attribute to off on both inputs, since it wouldn't make sense to have it on.

signUp.up:

  - Added _displayErrorSpan() and _hideErrorSpan() to avoid repetition.
  - Slightly adjusted the error span messages to make them a bit more understandable.
  - Abandoned the use of MessageDialog for now, as the error spans are already taking care of user feedback.


Bug fixes:

  - Fixed a bug where the password could accept any special characters, instead of only underscores and dots.
