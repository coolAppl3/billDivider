New:

  - Sign up functionality almost complete. A few adjustments to error messages is needed, as well as further functionality once a user successfully signs up.

  - Added ValidateUser.js into the server's /util. This will work as second layer of safety to prevent backend errors, in-case the front-end validation is bypassed or fails.

  - Added MessageDialog.js into the client's /util. This class will be used for important pop-up messages, but is still incomplete for now.

Changes:
  - Adjusted a few component names in alignment with convention and for the sake of consistency.

Bug fixes:

  - Fixed CORS not working properly in the development environment.
