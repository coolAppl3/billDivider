Frontend:

  - General:

    - Changed loadingModal.js to LoadingModal.js and set it as a class, with two static methods; display and remove.

    - Renamed messageDialog() to messagePopup(), as the previous name made no sense whatsoever.

    - Added ConfirmModal.js under components/global to be used throughout the application wherever needed.
  
  - SessionContent.js:

    - Imported, the now renamed, messagePopup().

    - Deleting bills now creates a popup message to confirm it to the user.

    - Deleting the final bill in a given list will now retract it.

    - Added _enableClearButtons() to check the sessionInfo object for bills. If either arrays is empty, the clear button is disabled. This function is called whenever a "render" or "sessionStarted" event is detected.

    - Clicking either of the clear displays the confirm modal. Functionality will be added in the next patch.
