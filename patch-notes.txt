Frontend:

  - General:

    - Minimum viable product reached! Further improvements coming in future patches.
  
    - Updated all components to reflect the backend endpoint changes.

    - Fixed SessionAPI.js's class being named SessionAPi. Typo fixed in all imports throughout the app.

    - Ran a build command in honour of reaching an MVP.
  
  - SessionHeader.js:

    - _saveSession() fully working. Its behavior will vary depending on whether the (logged in) user is editing a session or adding a new one.
  
  - SessionReference.js:

    - Fixed changesMade() requiring the user to pass in the sessionInfo object. The object has been directly imported into the module.
  
  - SessionAPI.js:

    - Updated the methods to reflect the recent changes in the API endpoints.

    - Removed the different URLs from the constructor, and unified them into this._sessionURL.

    - Added updateSession() as a PUT request for editing existing sessions.


Backend:

  - users.js:

    - Changed all session-related requests to target the same /api/users/session endpoint. They all now use proper requests to determine what needs to be done.

    - Login tokens are now exclusively sent within the request's header for all requests.

    - Fixed the DELETE request for /api/users/session/:sessionID returning the entire user history. This was forgotten about during API testing. It now returns a message confirming that the request was successful.

    - The DELETE request for /api/users/session/:sessionID now returns a 404 if the session doesn't exist.

    - Added a PUT request for /api/users/session/:sessionID.
