Fixes:

  - Insured all the links are okay in all the HTML pages.

New:

  - Added /global under js/components for global JS components.
  - Added navbar.js as a global component, and imported it into all JS files dedicated for pages with a navbar.
  - Added /services directory under js/components for API services.
  - Added loginToken.js under /services. Currently not in use.
