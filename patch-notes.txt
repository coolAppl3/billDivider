Frontend:

  - BillElement.js:

    - Fixed bill elements not containing the iconContainer which includes the edit and delete buttons.
  
  - SessionInfo.js:

    - Fixed totals being calculated off of the bills total values, and not the split value as they should be.
  
  - SessionHeader.js:

    - Added _updateDebtResult() to update the debtResult/debtResultValue elements, effectively communicating to the user whether they owe or are owed an amount, instead of dealing with negative values.

  - SessionContent.js:

    - Added _compareValueAndUnshared() to check and prevent:
    
      - The bill's value from being less than or equal to 0.
      - The unshared value from being less than 0.
      - The unshared value exceeding the bill's value.
    
    - Added _handleBillModalFormSubmission() to determine if the form's submission is meant to add a new bill, or update an existing one. _updateBill() is the function that will take care of updating the bill.

    - Added a billID argument to _displayBillModal() and set it to false by default. If one is passed in, a data-editing attribute is added to the bill modal form containing the bill's ID.

    - Clicking on a bill's edit icon will trigger _editBill(), which will:

      - Fetch the bill's ID from the element.
      - Figure out the contentList in question, then use _findBillOwner() to define the bill owner.
      - Call _displayBillModal() and pass in the billID.
      - Call _populateBillModal() and pass the billOwner and billID, which will fetch the bill's details from the sessionInfo object and append them to the inputs in the form.
