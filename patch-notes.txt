Frontend:

  - General

    - Added createDateString.js as a global component. This is an example of the date format: 14 Jan 2024.


  - history.js:

    - Imported HistoryHeader and HistoryContent in and initialized them. Similar to session.js, history.js will essentially just initialize the other components, and most of the work will be done through said components.

    - Added fetchUserHistory.js and fetchUsername.js as async components for history.js.

  - HistoryHeader.js:

    - Functionality complete for now.
  
  - HistoryAPI.js:

    - This class will handle a number of HTTP requests relating to history.js. Currently, it can fetch the username and the user's session history. 
  

  
  

Backend:

  - users.js:

    - Added a separate endpoint for fetching a username: api/users/username.
    
    - The api/users/history endpoint will only return the user's history moving forward.
