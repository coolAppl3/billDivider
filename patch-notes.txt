Frontend:

  - SessionInfo.js:

    - Added _handleSessionContentClickEvents() to handle all session-content click events, and avoid having many event listeners. A simple if-statement will call the appropriate function within the class depending on the event target.

    - Added two separate functions to expand and retract the contentList [_expandContentList() and _retractContentList()].

    - Added __resizeList() to handle contentList resize click events. It uses the two aforementioned functions.
  
  - session.html:

    - Changed the default chevron icon in the content header to aim to the right, and added a "rotate" class to rotate it 450 degrees.
