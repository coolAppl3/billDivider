Frontend:

  - ConfirmModal.js:

    - Event listeners will be handled within the function calling the modal, to avoid an event dispatch nightmare.

    - Added isExitClick() to determine if a click event's target was meant to exit the modal. This should help with abstraction.
  
  - SessionContent.js:

    - SessionContent is complete for now. Might revisit later for further optimization.
  
  - SessionInfo.js:

    - Added reset() which will set both totals to 0, and both bill arrays to empty arrays.
  
  - SessionHeader.js:

    - Added _resetSession() to clear all totals and bills, and dispatch a "render"event. A confirm modal is used to confirm the user's decision.
