Frontend:

  - messageDialog.js:

    - Fixed a bug with how the dialog element is removed, which caused errors when bills were being added quickly.

  - SessionContent.js:

    - Added _startBillModalEditMode() and _endBillModalEditMode() to dynamically change the text content of the title and submit button for the bill modal form when editing a bill.
    
    - Abolished _appendNewBill().

    - Added an eventListener for the custom "render" event, which will call _render(). This function will clear the bill elements using _clearContentList(), then load them again after the sessionInfo object was updated through the _addNewBill() or _editBill().

    - _clearContentList() will be used later down the line.

    - The functionality for adding/editing bills is complete currently.
