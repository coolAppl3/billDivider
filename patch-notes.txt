New:

  - Added locateLoginToken() in client /util to check for a loginToken in both sessionStorage and localStorage. Updated existing classes (e.g Navbar.js) to use this function when needing to find/use a loginToken.

  - Added loadingModal() in client /util to have general-use loading modal.


signUp.html:

  - Added a checkbox in the form for the user to decide if they want to stay logged in. This controls whether their loginToken, upon signing in/up, is stored in the sessionStorage or localStorage.


signUp.js:

  - Added _displayCheckBox() to change the give feedback to the user on whether the keepMeSignedIn checkbox is checked.

  - _signupUser() now looks for a "checked" class on the keepMeSignedIn checkbox to determine where to add the loginToken.

  - _signupUser(), and in turn, signUp.js is now complete.


Other changes:

  - MessageDialog is no longer a class, but a simple global messageDialog component. Updated its use across the app to reflect the changes. It now also has a "success" option to match the $success color variable.
