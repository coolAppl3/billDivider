Frontend:

  - signUp.html:

    - Added a homepage button alongside the returnToPreviousPage button.
    - Slight adjustments to accommodate both buttons.

  - signUp.js:

    - Added _handleFormLinks to the the returnToPreviousPage and homepage buttons, as they're not really links.
    - Fixed a bug where clicking the checkbox within the keepMeSignedIn button wouldn't work well. Problem was with the if-statement logic.

  - signIn.html:

    - Added the links container and keepMeSignedIn checkbox similar to signUp.html.

  - signIn.js:

    - Included the, now fixed, _displayCheckBox() function from signUp.js.
    - Included the same _handleFormLinks() function from signUp.js.
    - Included the same _displayErrorSpan() function from signUp.js, but amended it to account for the position of the revealPasswordBtn.
    - Included the same _hideErrorSpan() function from signUp.js, but amended it to account for the position of the revealPasswordBtn.
    - Added _usernameInputIsEmpty() and _passwordInputIsEmpty() to check if either fields is empty. No need for further validation, as the server will only have to check if the username exists, and validate whether the password is correct.


Backend:

  - users.js:
  
    - Changed the login functionality to a POST request, since GET requests don't allow a body.
    - Login API endpoint is now api/users/login.
