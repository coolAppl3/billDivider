New:

  - Added generateSessionID to /util. This will now create a 16-character long ID for every new session created. 

users.js:

  - Imported in generateSessionID.
  - The POST method on the /newSession path now uses generateSessionID to create a session ID, checks the user's history to ensure that the generated session ID is not already in use, then adds it to the session object before updating the user's history.
