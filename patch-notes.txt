Frontend:

  - General:

    - Removed messagePopup.js imports from modules not using it.
    - Installed jest as a dev dependency, and set-up its environment to work around import statements.
    - Unit testing has started.
  
  deleteSession.js:

    - Fixed Cookies not being imported.

  - messagePopup.js:

    - Renamed the old 'dialog' element to 'popup' within the function. Purely a semantic change.

  - addThousandComma.js:

    - The function now checks if a number is passed in, and returns undefined if not. It will also return undefined if anything but a number is passed in.
  
  - Cookies.js:

    - _setCookieExpiryDate() now returns undefined if the argument passed in is falsy, or not a type of number. This means that:

      - To ensure a cookie is temporary and has no age, ageMilliseconds shouldn't be passed in when calling set(). 0 (as a number) can also be passed in to achieve the same result.

      - To set a cookie with a given age, ageMilliseconds must be passed in. signIn.js and signUp.js now have a _loginTokenAge variable, which is now set to 14 days.

  - get() now first checks if a falsy value is passed in, and returns undefined if one was.

  
  - Unit testing:

    - addThousandComma.js passed unit testing.
    - Cookies.js passed unit testing.
