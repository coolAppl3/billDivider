Frontend:

  - General:

    - Added redirectAfterDelayMillisecond.js under global components. The function can take 4 arguments, 3 of which are optional:

      - target: The redirect destination. This argument is mandatory.
      - delay: Delay before the user is redirect. Default value is 1000ms.
      - message: Message to be displayed using messagePopup.js. The default message is "Something went wrong".
      - popupColor: The color of the message popup. Default color is "danger" (red).
    
    - Adopted the use of redirectAfterDelayMillisecond.js throughout the app where it made sense, to avoid repetitive code and improve readability.

  - SessionHeader.js:

    - _enableSaveButton() and _disableSaveButton() now set a session storage item called "unsavedSessionChanges", and give it a value of true or false accordingly.

    - Added a new if-statement to check if the unsavedSessionChanges item is false. If it is, but the function is still somehow called (users potentially inspecting the save button element), the function will abort and redirect the user depending on whether they are editing a new bill or creating a new one.
  
  - session.js:

    - _confirmExit() now relies on the unsavedSessionChanges item in session storage, rather than the save session button.
  
  - HistoryContent.js:

    - Sessions are now reversed before being displayed. This is to ensure the most recent sessions show up first, which makes much more sense.
  
  - BillModal.js:

    - Checking the "To be fully paid by" checkbox now disabled the unshared input, and sets its value to 0. This will help avoid confusion on the user's end.

    - Checkbox is now reachable and functional using only a keyboard.
  
  - signIn.js:

    - The "Keep me signed in" checkbox is now reachable and functional using only a keyboard.

  - signUp.js:

    - The "Keep me signed in" checkbox is now reachable and functional using only a keyboard.
