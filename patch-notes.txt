User.js:

  - Updated the User schema to now include an empty history by default. The user's history will be an array of previous sessions.

generateLoginToken.js:

  - Imported Users.js and made the function asynchronous, which now ensures that the randomized login token the user receives is always unique. This might not be an ideal solution in a complex application, but it should do here.

users.js:

  - Renamed router from user.js to users.js for the sake of consistency.
  - When submitting a post request to api/users/newSession, with a valid login token, the user's history is updated accordingly.
  - Added temporary GET functionality to api/users/:id for testing purposes. Will be removed once the backend is complete.
