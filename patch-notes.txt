Frontend:

  - BillModal.js:

    - Bills to be fully paid by the other party are now referred to as "directly owed". any mention of "toBeFullyPaid" has been renamed to directlyOwed.

    - Fixed populate() not dynamically setting the directlyOwed checkbox when launching the modal.

    - Added __directlyOwedCheckboxChecked() for the sake of better readability.
  

  BillElement.js:

    - Renamed _createToBeFullyPaidAlert() to _createDirectlyOwedTag().

    - _createDirectlyOwedTag() no longer includes a span, but rather simply states "Directly owed".
  
  
  -SessionInfo.js:

    - Changed how both totals are calculated to take into account whether or not a bill is directly owed.
  

  session.html:

    - Refactored the relevant ID's to use the directlyOwed logic.
