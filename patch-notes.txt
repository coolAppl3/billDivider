Frontend:

  - General:

    - Switched to using cookies for the loginToken, as using sessionStorage wouldn't be ideal for this website.

    - Removed any usage of local and session storage for now.

    - Added Cookies.js under global components. This class will take care of getting, setting, and removing any cookies on the site.

    - locateLoginToken() now uses Cookies.js to locate the loginToken.

    - Added HistoryAPI.js. This class will contain all history.js related HTTP requests.

    - Added HistoryContent.js and HistoryHeader.js as components for history.js.
  
  history.js:

    - Added _loadUserHistory() for now, but it will change in future patches, as the functionality will be split between HistoryContent.js and HistoryHeader.js.
  

Backend:

  - util/ValidateUser.js:

    - Fixed backend not matching front end validation.
