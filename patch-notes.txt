Frontend:

  - BillModal.js:

    - Added the option to mark a bill to be fully paid by the other party.

    - If the above options is checked, the resulting newBill/updatedBill object will reflect that in a boolean key-value pair.

    - newBill and updatedBill objects now contain a billOwner key-value pair.
  
  - BillElement.js:

    - Added an if statement to check if the bill is supposed to be fully paid by the other party, to remove the unshared and splitValue elements.

    - If the bill is edited to exclude the aforementioned option, the bill will be displayed normally after the app renders.
