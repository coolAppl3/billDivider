Frontend:

  - General:

    - Keyboard navigation possible throughout the app.

  - redirectAfterDelayMillisecond.js:

    - The function now checks for an unsavedSessionChanges item in session storage, and removes it before continuing to avoid conflict with confirmExit() in session.js.
  
  signUp.html:
  
    - The "Create a new account" title is no longer theme colored and is just white. This is for consistency sake, as well as to prevent to many CTA colors in one place.

    - Imported ErrorSpan and refactored existing functions to work with it.

    - _displayErrorSpan and _hideErrorSpan() are depreciated and removed.

    - Renamed _redirect() to _redirectIfLoggedIn().

    - Further refactoring coming in future patches.
  
  signUp.js:

    - Added an eye icon to hide/show the password when signing up, similarly to signIn.js.

    - Imported ErrorSpan and refactored existing functions to work with it.

    - _displayErrorSpan and _hideErrorSpan() are depreciated and removed.
    
    - Renamed _redirect() to _redirectIfLoggedIn().

    - Further refactoring coming in future patches.
  
  - signIn.js:

    - Fixed a bug where the loading modal wouldn't be removed after validating the value of the form inputs.
  
  - SessionElement.js:

    - Remove buttons now have a tabindex attribute added and set to 0 to make them selectable with a keyboard.
  
  HistoryContent.js:

    - Added _handleHistoryContentKeyEvents() to handle any "Enter" keyup events and make keyboard navigation possible.
  
  session.html:

    - Improved how both billModal and startModal are centered vertically, as it was not quite right and was causing issues with shorter devices.
  
  ErrorSpan.js:

    - Moved under global components, instead of unnecessarily being specific to session components. All related imports have been update accordingly.
