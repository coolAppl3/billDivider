Frontend:

  - loadingModal.js:
    - added an option to pass in an argument, and if it's equal to 'remove', the loadingModal is removed.

  - signIn.js:
    - Added _revealPassword() to change the password input type between password and text, as well as change the icon accordingly.
    - Added _redirect() to redirect the user if they're logged in but try to manually access signIn.html. It works by detecting the existence of a loginToken in localStorage and sessionStorage.
    - Completed the functionality of _signIn. signIn.js is fully implemented for now.


Backend:

  - server.js:
    - added 'http://46.240.183.31:5000' and '46.240.183.31:5000' to the CORS whitelist for development purposes.
