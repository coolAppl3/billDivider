Frontend:

  InitSession.js:

    - Fixed the startSessionModal showing "Start session" when it's used for editing who the session is shared with.
    
    - Added validation to the sharedWithInput, to disallow special characters and long names. Whitespace is allowed. Longer names might be allowed in future patches depending on the direction this app takes in terms of user freedom.
  
  SessionContent.js:

    - Added functionality to display/hide the bill modal.

    - Added _isNumber() to ensure the bill value and unshared value inputs are always numbers. Further validation coming in future patches.

  - session.html:

    - Fixed very long names breaking the how a bill's details are showing. Will run checks on the rest of the app in a future patch.
    
    - Fixed the start modal and bill modals now shrinking properly on lower resolutions due to being displayed as a grid. Changed to flex.

    - Added a cancel button to the bill modal for a better user experience, despite the fact that clicking outside of the form hides the modal.
