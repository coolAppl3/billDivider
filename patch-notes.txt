Frontend:

  - Added BillElement.js to take care of creating the bill elements within SessionContent.js.

  - messageDialog.js:

    - Made it so that the message flies up and is then removed, rather than it just sticking around.

  
  - SessionInfo.js:

    - Set up the constructor with basic values to make it easier for data entry within the app.
  
  SessionContent.js:

    - Added _clearBillModalForm() to ensure that the bill modal form is cleared every time it's closed.
    - _addNewBill() is now complete, and dispatches a "render" event, which will be used in other components.
