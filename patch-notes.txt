Frontend:

  - General:

    - Functionality for session.js as a whole is finished for the most part. Further work will be done once history.js is done.

    - Added HistoryAPI.js under /components/services.
  
  - SessionHeader.js:

    - Added _enableResetButton() to control when the reset button is enabled/disabled. The button is disabled by default.
  
  - SessionContent.js:

    - Content lists' clear buttons are now disabled by default, and rely on _render() to enable/disabled them. This is to avoid needing to list for a "sessionStarted" event just for this Functionality.
  
  history.js:

    - Created a History class and initialized it. Nothing added here yet.
  
  HistoryAPI.js:

    - Added getUserHistory() which will send the user's loginToken in the body, and retrieve the user's session history.


Backend:

  - users.js:

    - Added Functionality for POST requests to /api/users/history, with a valid loginToken in the body, to retrieve the user's session history.
