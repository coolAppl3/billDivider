General:

  - Added db.js to connect to MongoDB's database.
  - Created user.js to work as a router for requests coming to /api/users. This router will essentially handle login and signup functionality.
  - Created a User.js schema to dictate how a user object should look like.
  - Created a util directory, and added generateLoginToken.
