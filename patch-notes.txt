Frontend:

  -General:
  
    - Removed dispatchMainGlobalEvents.js. The abstraction simply wasn't worth it, and made the code a little less readable and intuitive.
  
  - BillModal.js:

    - The bill's name input is now only focused when adding a new bill to improve the user's experience.
  
  - InitSession.js:

    - _validateSharedWithInput() will now allow names longer than 15 characters long. Users will rarely input a name that long, but it's allowed now.
  
  - history.html:

    - Amended the CSS to workaround longer sharedWith names.
