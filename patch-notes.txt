Frontend:

  - General:

    - Moved addThousandComma.js to global components, as there's no reason for it to be specific to session.js.
  
    - Added SessionElement.js under history components to handle the creation of session elements, and imported into SessionContent.js.

    - Moving back to session.js in the next patch to complete its functionality.
  
  - session.js:

    - Imported LoadingModal. It will be displayed when the page loads, and removed when a "sessionsLoaded" is dispatched from SessionContent.js.
  
  - HistoryContent.js:

    - Added deleteSession.js under history.js components to handle the DELETE request.

    - Functionality complete for now.
